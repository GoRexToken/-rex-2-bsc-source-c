******* EDIT (2022, Sept. 16 == REX DAY 77): *******

ABOUT THE REX SOFTWARE - a little bit of background information for the interested reader.
Right before the deployment of the REX software on the "Binance Smart Chain" (BNBChain) blockchain, some Crypto experienced users required the REX team NOT to publish the REX software. The users publicly expressed concern that the REX software (and any inventions contained within) would be copied.
To prevent from being copied and to gain trust in the software nonetheless, the team and auditors have tried to prove that the AUDITED REX code (in this repository) matches the DEPLOYED code. For details please find the communication below.
Anyways, to make it short, it was technically NOT possible to prove this and and that could create uncertainty among new investors.
As this uncertainty is no longer justifiable, the team has decided to publish all the code and make it available to the general public.
This necessary step provides FULL transparency about all software details and shall finally convince people who doubted the code.
The REX team hereby invites the whole Crypto and DeFi community to do their own research on the REX software and explore it in-depth.
REX is - and has always been - fully decentralized and unchangeable software that everyone may use at will.
Thank you very much for taking the time to read this and for your trust in the REX software and team.
Yours, 
The REX team

ABOUT REX
The blockchain and crypto market, which is still very young, is experiencing great popularity, which is reflected in regular wave-like upswings. A trillion dollar market where users can trade directly, without banks and institutions and restrictions. All you need is internet access and a mobile phone.
Today there is a variety of products for everyone on the blockchain that are also available in traditional finance: short-term high-risk investments, but also long-term, safer investment options. Among the long-term options, the so-called "staking" enjoys great popularity.
STAKING works like a Certificate of Deposit, where the user locks their tokens up for a desired duration and earns rewards in return. Essentially, you can think of this as a next-generation savings account, but with much higher rewards than traditional finance and with vastly improved flexibility.
An example of such decentralized blockchain-based software that mimics Certificates of Deposit (CD) is REX ("XRX").
Unlike traditional CD products, which are offered, managed and controlled by banks and institutions, users interact directly with the REX software, at will, and experience no restrictions of any kind. The software is fully decentralized on the blockchain and it is forever unchangeable. In REX there is no owner and no administrator who can influence or switch off the software. So no trust in people is necessary, only trust in the software. In order to ensure the correct and long-term functioning of the software in the best possible way, the software was independently audited by three market-leading and well-known auditing companies. All code and audit reports are published and available to the general public.
With its newly developed functions, the REX software offers users unrivaled flexibility and a plethora of methods to manage their stakes/deposits. The most important invention that REX has brought forth and integrated is the possibility that, for the first time in Decentralized Finance, active Certificates of Deposits can be traded in a decentralized manner (the STAKE DEX). This makes a stake/deposit its own cryptocurrency and offers users unprecedented new experiences in asset management.
The rex.io website, the detailed whitepaper and numerous explanatory videos guide the user through the possibilities that smart contracts have in store for them. 
REX is crypto for the people.

Dear Auditors, 

All REX contracts have been deployed on Mainnet, initialized and the ownerships have been revoked.
Please find the proof of the "RevokeOwnership" (Txn links) below.

TREX: The contract has been published on bscscan.com.
(We don't mind people copy that code.)

We have NOT "published and verified" the mainnet contracts of "REX", "RDA/AUCTIONS" and "DEX" yet. 
And - frankly - we have decided to do anything possible to keep hiding the code, because we fear it will all be copied right away.
(The website has already been copied and people have been scammed. We managed to get their malicious website offline already / "rextoken.live".)

We want to do anything to protect REX investors and their values.
For that, we asked S.F how it would be possible to show investors, that the DEPLOYED contracts exactly match the AUDITED contracts.
S.F said, it would be possible, that the Auditors deploy the "finalcommit" contracts (REX/RDA/DEX) on testnet themselves - and then compare the BYTECODE to our mainnet deployment.

If that's the case, that this was a perfect proof, we would BEG you to support us doing that - and communicate it that way.  

So: The contracts deployed on Mainnet EXACTLY match the "finalcommit" here.
Can you check and confirm that?

If you could, would it be possible to somehow put that into the reports?

From our point of view, that would be a perfect solution.
The investors understand it's the audited code, but nobody can copy it.

Anyways, we'd love to publish the code in the future - maybe after the "auction phase" in 225 days - because we invented some new things and people should see that.

Please comment on that idea.

THANK YOU SO MUCH!

Please find the mainnet deployment details below.

Best regards
REX team

# Project Description / CONTRACTS
REX is a set of 6 smart contracts, made to run on Smart Chain (BSC).

****

1. REX (MAIN contract)

REX token is a STAKING TOKEN - with advanced functions and flexibilty (REX contract) - (uses RDA, DEX, AIRDROP, TREX contracts, used by DEX, AIRDROP, RDA).

FILE: REX_REX.sol (implements REX token, keeps time, provides all staking functions, supports a SharePrice model)

****

2. RDA

REX tokens are (partly) auctioned in 222 DAILY AUCTIONS (DAILY AUCTIONS contract).

FILE: REX_RDA.sol -> implements DAILY AUCTIONS, manages auctions, mints REX, adds liquidity to PancakeSwap (uses REX, MREX)

****

3. DEX

REX STAKES can be sold/bought on a DEX (DEX contract).

FILE: REX_DEX.sol -> implements a decentralized exchange (DEX) for REX STAKES (used by REX, uses REX and MREX)

****

4. AIRDROP

REX CLASSIC holders can claim a REX airdrop (AIRDROP contract).

FILE: REX_AIRDROP.sol -> manages a list of airdrop addresses, mints REX and creates REX STAKES (uses REX)

****

5. TREX

TREX (BEP20) is a supportive token, unlocking special functions in REX.

REX_TREX.sol -> implements TREX, an ERC20/BEP20 token and an own DEX to buy and sell TREX. (Used by REX and DAILY AUCTIONS)

****

6. MREX

MREX (BEP20) is a supportive token, unlocking special functions in REX.

Implements MREX, a simple ERC20/BEP20 token (used by DEX and DAILY AUCTIONS)

(already deployed, in use and "OwnershipRenounced")

# Compiler
We have compiled with

npx oz compile --optimizer on --optimizer-runs 1 --evm-version istanbul


# Website Concept
People use the MAIN WEBSITE (rex.io) to
* Learn about cryptocurrencies, staking, staking strategies, decentralized finance (DeFi) and REX
* Take part in 222 daily AUCTIONS (contract: REX_RDA.sol. They send BUSD and receive liquid or staked REX on the next day.)
* Claim BUSD from Personal Random BigPayDays (after taking part in AUCTIONS).
* Claim referral rewards, REX and BUSD.
* Buy REX via PancakeSwap (or rex.io interface).
* STAKE their REX (REX are burnt, SHARES are created. SHARES earn INTEREST for every staked day.)
* Buy and sell REX STAKES via integrated DEX contract.
* Buy and use TREX (more SHARES in a REX stake, higher limits in auctions,...) and MREX (more REX from auctions and referrals, no fees on DEX,...)
* Claim REX airdrop (liquid or staked REX), if the are in the REX CLASSIC snapshop
